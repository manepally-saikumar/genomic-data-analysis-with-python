    "Let's say we had to build a diagnostic test that detects the DNA (Ebola is actually RNA, but for testing, we can speak in terms of DNA since that is what is represented in genbank and the sequences.) We need the most conserved gene. What is the most conserved gene from all the past ebola outbreaks? Where should we focus our studies?\n",

    "    1. how many genes in the genome;\n",
